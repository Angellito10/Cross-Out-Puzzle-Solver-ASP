## Project Overview  

This project implements an **automated Cross-Out Puzzle solver** using **Answer Set Programming (ASP)**. The Cross-Out Puzzle consists of a rectangular grid of symbols, where some cells must be crossed out to satisfy specific **logical and structural constraints**.  

This repository:  

- Utilizes **Clingo** (an ASP solver) to solve the puzzle declaratively.  
- Provides a **Python visualization script** to interpret and display the solverâ€™s output in a grid format.  
- Demonstrates the power of **constraint programming** in solving structured combinatorial puzzles.  

---

## Objective  

The primary goal of this project is to solve Cross-Out Puzzles by ensuring:  

1. **Uniqueness Constraint**:  
   - No symbol repeats in any row or column among the **remaining (non-crossed-out) cells**.  

2. **No Adjacent Crossed-Out Cells**:  
   - Crossed-out cells **must not** be directly next to each other (horizontally or vertically).  

3. **Connected Component Constraint**:  
   - The remaining (non-crossed-out) cells **must form a single connected region** using vertical and horizontal moves.  

The project also aims to provide a **flexible** and **extendable** solution where:  

- The **grid input** can be modified easily within `ASP_puzzle.lp`.  
- The constraints are **dynamically applied**, ensuring puzzle consistency.

## Project Structure  

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ASP_puzzle.lp      # ASP code (puzzle facts + constraints)
â”œâ”€â”€ visual.py          # Python script to visualize solver output
â””â”€â”€ output.txt         # Example solver output
```

---

## Requirements  

- **Clingo** (ASP Solver) - Version 5.x or later  
- **Python 3** (for the visualization script)  

### Installation  

On Ubuntu/Debian, Clingo can be installed using:  

```bash
sudo apt install gringo clasp clingo
```

Or manually download it from the [Potassco GitHub Releases](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases).  

---

## Running the Solver and Visualizer  

### 1. Clone the Repository  

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git](https://github.com/Angellito10/Cross-Out-Puzzle-Solver-ASP.git)
cd Cross-Out-Puzzle-Solver-ASP
```

### 2. Solve the Puzzle Using ASP  

```bash
clingo ASP_puzzle.lp -n 0 > output.txt
```

- `ASP_puzzle.lp` contains **both the puzzle facts and constraints**.  
- `-n 0` finds **all possible valid solutions**.  
- The output is stored in `output.txt`.  

### 3. Visualize the Solution  

```bash
python3 visual.py
```

- The script **reads `output.txt`** and displays the puzzle grid, marking crossed-out cells with `X`.  

---

## Puzzle Explanation  

### Inputs and Outputs  

- **Puzzle Input:**  
  - The puzzle grid is encoded using `cell(Row, Column, "Symbol")` facts.  

- **Solver Output:**  
  - A set of `crossedout(Row, Column, "Symbol")` facts indicating which cells should be crossed out.  
  - The remaining cells (not crossed out) represent the **valid solution**.  

### Example Grid (5Ã—5)  

#### Initial Grid  

```
c  e  b  b  c  
b  e  a  d  e  
a  d  a  c  e  
c  a  b  e  c  
e  b  a  a  a  
```

#### Encoded as ASP Facts  

```prolog
cell(1,1,"c"). cell(1,2,"e"). cell(1,3,"b"). cell(1,4,"b"). cell(1,5,"c").
cell(2,1,"b"). cell(2,2,"e"). cell(2,3,"a"). cell(2,4,"d"). cell(2,5,"e").
cell(3,1,"a"). cell(3,2,"d"). cell(3,3,"a"). cell(3,4,"c"). cell(3,5,"e").
cell(4,1,"c"). cell(4,2,"a"). cell(4,3,"b"). cell(4,4,"e"). cell(4,5,"c").
cell(5,1,"e"). cell(5,2,"b"). cell(5,3,"a"). cell(5,4,"a"). cell(5,5,"a").
```

## Constraints and Logic Flow  

1. **Symbol Uniqueness**  
   - No symbol can appear **twice** in the same row or column among the **non-crossed-out cells**.  

2. **No Adjacent Crossed-Out Cells**  
   - Crossed-out cells **must not** be directly next to each other.  

3. **Connectivity of Remaining Cells**  
   - The remaining cells must **form a single connected component** using only vertical and horizontal connections.  

---

## Implementation Details  

- **ASP Choice Rules**:  
  - Guess which cells should be crossed out.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Enforce row/column uniqueness.  
  - Prevent adjacent crossed-out cells.  
  - Ensure remaining cells form a connected region.  

---

## ASP Code Explanation (`ASP_puzzle.lp`)  

### Key Features  

1. **Symbol Check**  
   - Ensures that no **two non-crossed-out cells** in the same row/column share the same symbol.  

2. **Cross-Out Adjacency Check**  
   - Prevents adjacent crossed-out cells.  

3. **Connectivity Enforcement**  
   - Uses a **root selection** method to ensure **all non-crossed-out cells** are connected.  

---

## Visualization Script Explanation (`visual.py`)  

- Reads `output.txt`.  
- Parses the solverâ€™s output into a **grid format**.  
- Displays the puzzle with `X` marking crossed-out cells.  

Example Output:  

```
c  e  X  b  X  
b  X  a  d  e  
a  d  X  c  X  
X  a  b  e  c  
e  b  X  a  X  
```

## Ethical Considerations  

While this project is a **puzzle-solving tool**, it demonstrates the broader **potential of constraint-solving techniques**.  

- **Optimization & Decision Making**:  
  - Constraint solvers are widely used in **scheduling, logistics, and AI planning**.  
- **Transparency & Fairness**:  
  - The logic-based approach ensures **predictability** and **explainability**.  

---

## Conclusion  

This **Cross-Out Puzzle Solver** showcases the power of **Answer Set Programming (ASP)** for solving **constraint satisfaction problems**.  

Key Takeaways:  

âœ” **Deterministic root selection** avoids redundant solutions.  
âœ” **Minimal adjacency rules** reduce redundant constraints.  
âœ” **Fully automated** solver with **clear visualization output**.
